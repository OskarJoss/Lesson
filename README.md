## Exercises

1. Create a new [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) on Github

2. To be able to see anything on our new site we need to create a basic HTML file. Remember that web servers are looking for [index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webserver_directory_index) files if you're visiting the [root domain](https://raventools.com/marketing-glossary/root-domain/)? Create a new index.html file within your repository. Copy and paste the snippet below. Add, commit and push your changes to GitHub.

> **Tips:** Remember how to get the project to your local computer? [Clone your new repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)
   
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8" />
            <title>Netlify</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello Netlify!</h1>
